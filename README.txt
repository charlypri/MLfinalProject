Project Topic
The main topic of our project is to generate an image classifier that estimates whether a picture
depicts a recyclable object or an organic one. To do this we will design and train a neural
network that will carry out this classification task.
Data
The dataset that we have used can be found at this link. The training set is formed by 12.567
pictures of “organic” elements and 10,000 pictures of “recyclable” elements, which makes this
dataset really well-balanced and also big enough to make a really good classifier since the
dataset is really broad. The test set is formed by 1401 pictures of “organic” elements and 1112
pictures of “recyclable” elements. This makes our data divided into 85% training images and
15% as test images all of them are RGB colored.
